# Contributing to Avalanche CMS

## Welcome

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Avalanche CMS! This document provides guidelines for contributing to the project. As a community-driven project, your contributions are essential for its growth and success.

## Project Overview

Avalanche CMS is an image-based CMS designed for curating and refining AI-generated artwork. It's a valuable tool for anyone engaged in visual exploration and digital art creation within the generative AI space.

The project is in its early development stages. The focus is currently on establishing the basic components and technologies essential for the project's foundation. 

## How to Contribute

### Getting Started

1. **Read the README:** Start by reading the [README.md](/README.md) in the root of the project to understand the basics.
2. Setup for Local Development:
   - Follow the instructions in [/environments/local/README.md](/environments/local/README.md) for setting up the local development environment. This includes running the `setup.py` script and other necessary steps.
   - Familiarize yourself with the project's workflows, use cases, data models, etc., by going through documents in the `/docs` directory. These documents are works in progress but provide insights into the project's development.

### Code Contributions

- **Technologies:** The main stack includes Java 21, Maven, Python 3, and Shell (Bash) in dockerized environments.
- **Development Environment:** The primary development environment is Windows 11. While Linux support exist thanks to the technology selection, it is considered secondary and maintained on a best-effort basis.
- Contribution Process:
  - Please create separate branches for your contributions.
  - Ensure all commits from the main are synced and tested thoroughly before opening a pull request.

### Issue Tracking

- Report issues via GitHub issues.
- Include a detailed description of the problem/thought/feature request.
- If applicable, provide a bullet point checklist to outline requirements (must-have, should-have, nice-to-have).
- Suggest more than one solution if possible.
- Note: As this is a best-effort project, there is no guarantee that external feature requests will be implemented, and issues will be resolved maybe with a different priority as you might expect.

### Pull Requests

- Make sure all commits from the main branch are synced and tested thoroughly before opening a pull request.
