# Concept Mining Workflow

## Problem Statement

Creators employing generative AI for image concept extraction encounter difficulties in effectively documenting and overseeing the progression of prompts, variations, and creative decisions. This is because many AI tools need creators to move data by hand, making the creative process disorganized and hard to handle.

Once a concept is distilled, generated AI images could be still vulnerable to potential legal risks, because fragments of the prompt can still infringe on copyright or violate community standards.

An ideal solution would streamline the creative process, allow organization of source content, allow exploration of prompts and image lineage, integrate with AI tools, provide legal screening and a user-friendly interface.

## Planned Solution with Avalanche CMS

Avalanche CMS provides with the Concept Mining Workflow a streamlined approach to this creative process. It offers a centralized platform incorporating the following solutions:

- **Upload and Organize Original Images**: Users can upload and organize source content they are working from. This allows them to easily reference and compare their source content with the generated images, keeping everything related to a project in one place.

- **Prompt and Image Tracking**: Users can document each step of their image refinement process, where separate entries for each prompt and generated image create a clear, trackable history. Users can also go back to intermediate versions and explore from there new refinement paths.

- **Interactive Graph Interface**: A graph-based interface represents the prompt and image evolutions in 2D space. Users can easily move around to add, edit, filter and see different prompt and image versions. They can also collapse pathways and save different views to their work.

- **AI Integration**: AI features are provided to suggest and analyse users' prompts for improvement. Seamless integration with Midjourney is provided for moving results from Discord to Avalanche, and possibly, invoke Midjourney commands like /describe, /shorten and /imagine.

- **AI Integration**: AI features are provided to suggest and analyze users' prompts for improvement and legal content screening.

- **Integration**: Seamless integration with AI tools is supported to facilitate the transfer of results from and to Avalanche CMS, enhancing workflow efficiency.

- **Customizable Tagging and Sorting**: Users can organize their work with custom tags and sort them in different ways, which makes finding and managing projects, original images, prompts and generated art easier.

With these features, Avalanche CMS facilitates efficient concept mining and extraction, empowering creators to derive inspiration from existing images and develop new, original artwork based on those concepts.
