# Avalanche CMS Image Echoing Workflow

## Problem Statement

Creators using generative AI to replicate images face challenges in efficiently documenting and managing the evolution of their prompts, variations, and creative decisions. Current tools often require manual data transfer from command line or Discord, leading to a disorganized and cumbersome process.

An ideal solution would streamline the creative process, allow organization of source material, allow exploration of prompts and their generated image lineage, integrate with the used AI tool and provide a user-friendly interface.

## Planned Solution with Avalanche CMS

Avalanche CMS provides with the Image Echoing workflow a streamlined approach to this creative process. It offers a centralized platform incorporating the following solutions:

- **Upload and Organize Original Images**: Users can upload and organize the original images they are working from. This allows them to easily reference and compare their source material with the generated images, keeping everything related to a project in one place.

- **Prompt and Image Tracking**: Users can document each step of their image refinement process, where separate entries for each prompt and generated image create a clear, chronological history. Users can also go back to intermediate versions and explore from there new refinement paths.

- **Interactive Graph Interface**: A graph-based interface represents the prompt and image evolutions in 2D space. Users can easily move around to add, edit, filter and see different prompt and image versions. They can also collapse pathways and save different views to their work.

- **AI Integration**: AI features are provided to suggest and analyse users' prompts for improvement. Seamless integration with Midjourney is provided for moving results from Discord to Avalanche, and possibly, invoke Midjourney commands like /describe, /shorten and /imagine.

- **Customizable Tagging and Sorting**: Users can organize their work with custom tags and sort them in different ways, which makes finding and managing projects, original images, prompts and generated art easier.

With these features, Avalanche CMS makes it easier for creators to efficiently replicate images and then develop new, original artwork from that basis.
